# Openbox HUD

This script is intended to simplify assigning 
laptop-specific keys and events to actions and display a GNOME-like
graphical messages in [Openbox](http://openbox.org) window manager. 
This way one can, for instance, change volume level or screen brightness 
and see a graphical confirmation by just binding a key to a single 
command. Furthermore - assigning a command in [Tint2](https://gitlab.com/o9000/tint2) 
preferences allows to see alerts concerning the AC and
battery state, and also suspend on critical battery level.
